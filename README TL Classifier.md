## Short Documenntation on Traffic Light classifier

### Training the Classifier
***classifier_trainer.py***: contains class ***TLClassifier_Trainer***. This part is the core of the training stage. It reads in sample files and - using a **LeNet** architecture - does the trainig stage and finally stores the model in respective files (*model.** in *light_classification* directory). For now, labeling the images is done by hand, just putting the images in respective directories. The directory structure is as follows:
	- top dir is *pics*
	- the images are stored in directories named *GREEN*, *YELLOW*, *RED* and *UNKNOWN*, respectively:

	(...) light_classification
								
					--> pics
								--> GREEN
								--> YELLOW
								--> RED 
								--> UNKNOWN

The classifier reads in the images from each directory; by knowing the directory the labels are derived.

**Flags:**

* *self.debug = False*: Change to true if you need debug messages. Beware of switching to true when running ROS, the *"debug"* output is just print messages to standard output

### Consuming the Classifier
***tl_classifier.py***: (Provided by **Udacity**): contains *TLClassifier()* class. This  is the *"Client"* class; it loads the model stored in the training step and classifies incoming images. It reuses the logits from the trainer (Not strictly required, but avoids code duplication)

**Flags:**

* *self.debug = True*: set this to false to avoid ROS loginfo messages
* *self.capture_images* = False: Set to True to store incoming images


### Helper/Invoking the Classifier
***train.py***: short helper class. Use this if you need to invoke training. It just instantiates the training class and invokes training.
